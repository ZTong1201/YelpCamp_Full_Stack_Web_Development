## YelpCamp - Full Stack Web Development
This is a full stack web development project of [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) on udemy.
Basically, the project is a clone of yelp methodologies to recommend campgrounds from all over the world. This web-based application designed
some funtionalities like user authentication/authorization, add/edit/delete campgrounds you built, add/edit/delete comments and reviews you left, like/unlike any
posts, and more!

You can try to visit the website by this link: [YelpCamp Collections](https://yelpcampcollections.herokuapp.com/)

Funtionalities | Tools/Frameworks
--------------- | ---------------
Front-End | HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4, JavaScript
Backend | Node.js
Database | MongoDB
Server-side Framework | Express.js
Routes | RESTful APIs
Authentication/Authorization | Passport.js, Passport-local

Here are some pictures of how the app works.

Meanwhile, I also implemented several forms to add/edit campgrounds, login, and sign up. All of these RESTful routes should be worked
appropriately on this web application. If you have any concerns or questions, please feel free to submit a pull request. Enjoy the Campgrounds!
