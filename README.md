# YelpCamp - Full Stack Web Development
This is a full stack web development project of [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) on udemy.
Basically, the project is a clone of yelp methodologies to recommend campgrounds from all over the world. This web-based application designed
some funtionalities like user authentication/authorization, add/edit/delete campgrounds you built, add/edit/delete comments and reviews you left, like/unlike any
posts, and more!
